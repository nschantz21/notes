Schaum's
Measures of Central Tendency
    The most important measures of central tendency are (1) the mean, (2) the median, and (3) the mode.
    For populations and samples
    For grouped and ungrouped data

    weighted mean, the geometric mean, and the harmonic mean

    geometric mean - average rates of change and index numbers
    harmonic mean - avg of ratios
    quantiles - grouped and ungrouped

Measures of Dispersion - For sample, population, grouped, ungrouped

    Mean Average Deviation (MAD)
    Variance
    Standard Deviation
    range - useful in quality control
    Cumulative Distribution Function
    Probability Distribution Function
    interquantile range - not affected by extreme values
    Quantile Range - measures average range of each quantile
    Coefficient of Variation - for relative dispersion - the coefficient of variation can be used to compare the relative dispersion of two or more distributions expressed in different units, as well as when the true mean values differ. Also can be used to compare the relative dispersion of the same type of data over different time periods.

Shape of Frequency Distributions
    skewness - Pearson Coefficient of Skewness
    kurtosis
    Covariance if two variables

Visualizations
    Frequency
    Relative Frequency - groups
    Frequency Polygon
    Ogive - cumulative frequency distribution - graphs that can be used to determine how many data values lie above or below a particular value in a data set. The cumulative frequency is calculated from a frequency table, by adding each frequency to the total of the frequencies of all data values before it in the data set. The last value for the cumulative frequency will always be equal to the total number of data values, since all frequencies will already have been added to the previous total.

Probability Characteristics
     Mutually Exclusive or not - Venn Diagram
     Independent or not
     Probability Distribution
          Classical/Relative/Empirical Frequency
          Discrete Independent Outcomes

               Binomial - to find the probability of X number of occurrences or successes of an event, P(X), in n trials of the same experiment when (1) there are only 2 mutually exclusive outcomes, (2) the n trials are independent, and (3) the probability of occurrence or success, p, remains constant in each trial.
               
               hypergeometric distribution - Finite population without replacement - the binomial distribution (which is easier to use) is a good approximation for the hypergeometric distribution
               
               Poisson - the Poisson distribution is used to find the probability of a designated number of successes per unit of time. Can be used to estimate the binomial distribution when the sample size is large and the prob of one of the outcomes is small - just easier than binomial in that case.

          Continuous
               Normal
                    probability density function
                    Can be used to approximate other distributions - Distributions of sample means and proportions are often normal, even if the parent distribution is not

               Exponential - If events or successes follow a Poisson distribution, we can determine the probability that the first event occurs within a designated period of time, by the exponential probability distribution.  The exponential distribution also can be used to calculate the time between two successive events.

    Symmetry or Asymmetry of Prob Distro
    You can use Chebyshev's Theorem for prob of random sample even if population distribution is unknown.


Analysis of Financial Time Series - Tsay
    This is for analysis of asset returns - assumes dividend payments, if any, are included in returns
    Moments of Continuous Distribution
        First Moment - measures the central location of the distribution - Mean/Expectation of X
        Second Moment - Measures Variability of X - Variance
        Third Moment - Measures Symmetry of X with respect to its mean - skewness
        Fourth Moment - Measures Tail Behavior of X - kurtosis

    Excess Kurtosis - Kurtosis(X) - 3
    Hypothesis test for normality of asset returns  - Sample skewness and sample kurtosis - p10
    JB Statistic combines the two

Distribution of Returns - what type of distribution should you assume
    Different Distributional specifications lead to different theories
    Conditional Distribution - Inter-temporal distribution
    Marginal Distribution
        Normal
        log normal isn't bad
        Scale Mixture of Normal Distributions - Advantages of mixtures of normal include that they maintain the tractability of normal, have  finite higher order moments, and can capture the excess kurtosis. Yet it is hard to estimate the mixture parameters - uses Bernoulli random variable

    Use Multivariate  normal distribution for the cross-sectional log returns of multiple assets in a time series
