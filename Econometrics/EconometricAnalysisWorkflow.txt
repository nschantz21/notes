Economic or financial theory (previous studies)

Formulation of an estimable theoretical model
    Mathematical Model
        e.g. Output = Input * Productivity - Fixed Cost
    Econometric (Stochastic) Model
        e.g. Output = Input * Productivity - Fixed Cost + Exogenous Variable(s)

Collection of Appropriate Data
    Data Source Documentation - common framework used across models
    Set up scripts
    Storage considerations

Data Exploration
    Gain insights based on exploration
    Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations based on the nature of the data
        Sample size needed

Data Preparation
    Prep data to better expose the underlying data patterns to Machine Learning Algorithms

Modeling

    Model Selection
    Hypothesis formation - this might not go in this step
          State above theory in hypothesis form and set testing criteria
    Statistical Inference
        Estimation
            Estimation of poplation parameter from sample (Estimation of the Coefficients of the function)
        Statistical Analysis
            Hypothesis testing, maybe visualizations too
    Refinement
        Check for data leakage - Leaky Predictors and Leaky Validation Stategies
    Interpretation

Present Solution - or scrap model

Production -  The context in which the finished model is used

    Launch, Monitor, and Maintain system
