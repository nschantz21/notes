Getting Started with pandas

    you pretty much know all this already.
    
    use multiindexing to simulate multidimensional array.  You can do summary stats by index level.
        
        frame.sum(level='key2')
        frame.sum(level='color', axis=1)
        

Passing how='all' will only drop rows that are all NA:
    
    data.dropna(how='all')
    
you can also filter out rows containing a certain number of observations.

    df.dropna(thresh=3) # three columns need to have values
