When columns of a df are actually values of a variables, you should use tidyr::gather() to transform the data.

Use dplyr::left_join() for relational joins

Use tidyr::spread() when an observation is scattered across multiple rows (the opposite of tidyr::gather()).

gather() makes wide tables narrower and longer; spread() makes long tables shorter and wider.

tidyr::separate() pulls apart one column into multiple columns, by splitting wherever a separator character appears. It's like split()

tidyr::unite() is the inverse of separate(): it combines multiple columns into a single column.

Missing Values:

  Because explicit missing values may not be important in other representations of the data, you can set na.rm = TRUE in gather() to turn explicit missing values implicit:

  Another important tool for making missing values explicit in tidy data is tidyr::complete()
  
  complete() takes a set of columns, and finds all unique combinations. It then ensures the original dataset contains all those values, filling in explicit NAs where necessary.
  
  use the tidyr::fill() function to fill missing data based on existing data.
